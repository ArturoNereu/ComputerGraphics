# ComputerGraphics
A repository documenting Computer Graphics for real time applications

### Is Computer Graphics programming for me? Or where to start.
- [How to Start Learning Computer Graphics Programming](https://erkaman.github.io/posts/beginner_computer_graphics.html)

### Shaders 

#### Shading Languages
- [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL))
- [HLSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl) The High Level Shading Language for DirectX
- [CG](https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit) NVIDIA's *deprecated* programmable shading language.
- [Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) Small but rich language for programmable shading in advanced renderers and other applications.

#### Sandboxes
Put your skills to use, learn, try and more by using these online shader sandboxes:
- [ShaderToy](https://shadertoy.com)
- [pocket.gl](http://pocket.gl/)
- [Shdr](http://shdr.bkcore.com/)
- [Shadron](https://www.arteryengine.com/shadron) Shadron is the ultimate graphics editor for programmers

### Graphics APIs
- [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)
- [DirectX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/directx-12-programming-guide)
- [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/)
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/)


#### Learning
- [Pixel Spirit Deck](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.github.io/PixelSpiritDeck/) A set of phisical cards that helps you learn shader development with GLSL (but really applies to any shader language).

### Tools
- [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) A must use tool to inspect, debug and analize your frames.
- [NVIDIA Nsight Graphics](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics) Tool by NVIDIA to analize your frames. Direct3D, Vulkan, OpenGL, etc.

### Books
- [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/) *free online*
- [Real Time Rendering](http://www.realtimerendering.com/)
- [The Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com/) 
- [Ray Tracing in a Weekend, book series ](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/)*free online*

#### Math
- [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6)*free online*

### Render Engines

#### Game Engines
- [Unity](http://unity3d.com/)
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) 
- [Amazon Lumberyard](https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Frostbite](https://www.ea.com/frostbite)

And this very interesting study on [Custom Game Engines](https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74) by raylib


#### Physically Based
- [Filament Project by Google](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html#about) Real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS and WASM/WebGL
- [Mitsuba 2 Renderer](http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/) Mitsuba 2 is a research-oriented retargetable rendering system, written in portable C++17.

#### Path/Ray Tracing
