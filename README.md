# ComputerGraphics
A repository documenting Computer Graphics for real time applications

### Is Computer Graphics programming for me? Or where to start.
- [How to Start Learning Computer Graphics Programming](https://erkaman.github.io/posts/beginner_computer_graphics.html)

### Shader Sandboxes
Put your skills to use, learn, try and more by using these online shader sandboxes:
- [ShaderToy](https://shadertoy.com)
- [pocket.gl](http://pocket.gl/)
- [Shdr](http://shdr.bkcore.com/)

### Tools
- [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) A must use tool to inspect, debug and analize your frames.
- [NVIDIA Nsight Graphics](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics) Tool by NVIDIA to analize your frames. Direct3D, Vulkan, OpenGL, etc.
